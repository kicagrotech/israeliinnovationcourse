title : Why Learn Israeli Innovation Methods? 
description : "Despite Israel's small size, relatively young economy and culturally diverse population, Israel is an entrepreneurial powerhouse and a hotbed for pioneering technologies and profitable business opportunities. Together with the Silicon Valley in California and the economic capitals of Europe, Israel consistently ranks as one of the world's top locations for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, Hence, more than 200 MNCs have a presence in Israel, notably Microsoft, Motorola, Google, Apple, Facebook, Berkshire-Hathaway, Intel, HP, Siemens, GE, IBM, Philips, Lucent, AOL, Cisco, Applied Materials, IBM, J&J, EMC, and Toshiba. 
 
The secret to Israelâ€™s success is the Israeli innovative cultural way of thinking. Through this course, we will share our recipe for success because we believe that innovation comes through collaboration. As Israel and China grow ever closer, business, diplomatic and tourism connections between the two modern states continue unabated. By fostering deeper and broader interaction between both countries, we will strive towards a shared goal of making the world a place.
